# data-collection-challenge
This project consists of two parts: scraping and analyzing Mars data. In Part 1, we scrape the latest Mars news titles and previews from a website using web scraping techniques. In Part 2, we focus on scraping and analyzing Mars weather data, specifically looking at temperature and atmospheric pressure information.

Part 1: Mars News Scraping

We use automated web browsing to access the Mars news site.
Text elements are extracted from the website using Beautiful Soup.
Extracted news titles and previews are stored in Python data structures.

Part 2: Mars Weather Data Scraping and Analysis

We scrape Mars weather data, focusing on temperature and atmospheric pressure.
Data from an HTML table is extracted using Beautiful Soup.
The scraped data is structured into a Pandas DataFrame, examined, and prepared for analysis.
Key questions are answered using Pandas functions, and data visualizations are created.
The resulting data is saved to a CSV file for further use.

Usage:

Ensure necessary libraries are installed, including Splinter, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
Refer to provided Jupyter Notebooks for instructions on running the code.
Data Storage:

Scraped Mars news data is saved in JSON format ('scraped_data.json').
Mars weather data is stored in a CSV file ('mars_weather_data.csv').
This project provides a comprehensive exploration of Mars data, offering insights into both current events and weather conditions on the red planet.

While working on this module, I used Google, Xpert Learning Assistant, Chat GPT, and tutor sessions, which helped me build and run the code.
